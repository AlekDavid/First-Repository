<p>
    “Where is my mind?” is a song made by the group band “Pixies”, released in 1988; which frankly, talks about a great variety of different things, with the common factor of the feeling of being lost. What’s interesting about this song is that, its success wasn’t predicted; its success wasn’t something that the band expected due to the fact that, if viewed from a music and lyrics production standpoint, the song is really simple; even more after considering some of the artists comments on the song’s birth and success: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Joey Santiago in an NME interview, published in 2014, about the popular song, explains that he improvised and created the riff of the guitar, just right after Black Francis showed him the chord progressions of the song.</li>
    <li> •	Black Francis in an IGN interview, published in 2009, reveals that he doesn’t understand at full depth the reasons for the song’s popularity – he just thinks that it’s “likeable”.
        “…It sort of displays everyone’s personalities are very strong. The song has something very likeable about it and I’m not sure what it is.”  (Black Francis, 2009) </li>    
</ul>

<div>It’s easy to conclude that there wasn’t much thought put out into everything, but rather, raw taste, ability, and emotion. </div>

<p>My interpretation is that, the song is largely successful due to two things: the youth and raw emotion of the artists at the time in which they made the song, and the non-specificity of the lyrics. For you see, the more remembered section of the song, the section which takes more space than all others, the chorus, has only two, very interesting phrases, which contain all of the power for its relatability towards a teenage audience. Such phrases are the question, “Where is my mind?” and, “Way out in the water, see it swimming”. These verses have an immense variety of interpretations, but a generic, simplified one, is the state of mind in which almost all people go through: insecurity. The state of being lost inside one’s vast train of thought, and not finding an answer or solution to their everyday problems. Not finding closure. Not finding salvation, relief, calmness, comfort. </p>

<p>If you ask any person what they think about these lyrics in the chorus, you’d get what they resonate with the most; and what sort of problems they might have. This is because, if considered, the attributes of those phrases can be found in a lot of circumstances relating personal problems. Such as depression, insomnia, drug addiction, high expectations, fear of the future, guilt of the past, the inability to achieve one’s own goals, overthinking, the list goes on. All people go through different problems, but the great majority who have access to this song via globalization, are all in a similar position: they’re lost in their own personal world, trying to find a place or path in which they can set themselves to be without worries or preoccupations; they’re lost in their minds, in search for a way to escape their problems. No matter which specific problem you have in your mind, the song would still resonate with you.</p>

<div>These two phrases are the backbone of the song’s popularity; for the ones who are most in these types of situations, are teenagers; the consumers of media, the granters of fame.</div>

<p>The song’s production may have come naturally without much thought or intention of depth in the lyrics, but ironically, it resonates in great levels with those who have some form of existential crisis, especially teenagers; hence its popularity. I can safely say that it’s a great piece of art, not just in the sense that it’s good music; but in the sense that it can tell many stories within the lyrics, and yet most interpretations are very close to what the artists felt while composing this. Good art tells a good story, and here, the story is about you.</p>
